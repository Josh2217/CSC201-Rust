# Assignment 2

Have the program output your first and last name

Email your Java source file to my email address.

Using a Scanner, read three integer values from the user (don’t worry about gracefully handling bad input…it is ok if your program crashes if given invalid input!)

Compute and output the average of the three numbers

Compute and output the sum of the three numbers

Compute and output the product of the three numbers

If the first number is greater than the second, output “#1 is bigger than #2” otherwise output “#2 is bigger than #1”

If the sum of the first and second number is greater than or equal to the third number, output “sum wins!” otherwise output “#3 is hefty hefty hefty”

If all three numbers are odd, output “how odd” otherwise output “lucky duck”

Using a for loop or while loop, output the numbers 1 to 5, one per line
